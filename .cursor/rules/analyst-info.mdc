# Shooting Sports Analyst

This project is Shooting Sports Analyst, an application for producing Elo and other ratings
for competitors in practical shooting sports like USPSA, IDPA, PCSL, ICORE, and multigun. It
also has advanced features for viewing and comparing results, and watching matches live.

## Infrastructure
The project's database is in [analyst_database.dart](mdc:lib/data/database/analyst_database.dart).

There is a logger in [logger.dart](mdc:lib/logger.dart), which should be instantiated as `var _log = SSALogger("LogTag")` when
needed.
