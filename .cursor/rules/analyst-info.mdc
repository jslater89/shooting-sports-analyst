# Shooting Sports Analyst

This project is Shooting Sports Analyst, an application for producing Elo and other ratings
for competitors in practical shooting sports like USPSA, IDPA, PCSL, ICORE, and multigun. It
also has advanced features for viewing and comparing results, and watching matches live.

## Infrastructure
The project's database is in [analyst_database.dart](mdc:lib/data/database/analyst_database.dart).

There is a logger in [logger.dart](mdc:lib/logger.dart), which should be instantiated as `var _log = SSALogger("LogTag")` when
needed.

## Practical Shooting Primer
Practical shooting sports are a subset of shooting sports, distinguished by time-based scoring
(faster is better, given the same accuracy), penalties for inaccuracy, and oftentimes, but not
always, movement.

Matches are organized into stages, or courses of fire. Each stage is scored separately, and match
scores are a sum of the stage scores in some way.
