# USPSA Match Results Viewer

A web application for viewing USPSA match results, usable standalone at
[github.io](https://jslater89.github.io/uspsa-result-viewer), or embedded
into an iframe.

## Building

Copy web/index-template.html to web/index.html, then use `flutter build web`.

## Linking

URLs to results downloaded from PractiScore can be shared, e.g.

`https://jslater89.github.io/uspsa-result-viewer/#/web/d7b9c599-9387-4faf-b3ff-545965947e99`

## Embedding

See [this example file](https://github.com/jslater89/uspsa-result-viewer/blob/master/embedded-index.html).

If embedding, it's best to host your own results file and link to that, rather
than linking to the PractiScore page. The PractiScore page scraper uses a free
Heroku service to serve as a CORS proxy, and as a free Heroku service, it takes
several seconds to start up if it hasn't been used in the last half hour.

Visiting the link generated by the embedded URL will create a friendly link in
your browser's URL bar.  

## Known Issues

* May not match PractiScore precisely on DQed shooters.
